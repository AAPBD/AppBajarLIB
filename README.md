Guys,
Hope you are well. Finally the AppBajarLib is at Github. But need a person who can help me to prepare SDK Documentation.

I think, it will save 50% development time by re-using common actions/codes.


I will share the Gradle/JCenter link within next 4/5 days.
https://github.com/AAPBD/AppBajarLIB


Example:-

To make Activity full screen, just call
DisplayUtils.fullScreen(youractivityname);


To open keyboard, call
KeyBoardManager.openKeyBoard(Context con, final View v);


To remember login/logout state and save logged user info,
PersistentUser.getInstance().setLogin(Context c);


NOTHING IS NEW BUT EVERYTHING IS REDEFINED. It's an output of 6 years work!
